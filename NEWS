In problem.train we got
Error in plot_clone(p) : attempt to apply non-function
with ggplot2_2.2.1 installed, and
Imports: ggplot2Animint, animint2
I think this has something to do with conflicting S3 methods
for the gg class.
For now I fixed it by moving these Imports to Suggests,
and using requireNamespace and animint2:: and ggplot2Animint::

2017.09.01

use animint2 instead of animint.

First green build with three jobs on travis: CRAN, input, noinput.

2017.08.11

add bigwig.R and mclapply.R (removed from PeakSegJoint).

2017.08.09

compiling, installing, passing demo test.

pipeline stops in target interval computation if there is non-integer
data in bigWig files.

import PeakSegJoint >= 2017.08.08 which returns mean.mat, which we use
to derive a log peak height relative to background, in
problem.joint.predict.

2017.06.19

copied code from PeakSegFPOP repo, modified for R interface.
